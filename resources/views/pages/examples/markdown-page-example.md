## Footnotes

Markdown can also handle footnotes nicely.[^1]

    text.

## Wrapping Up

That’s a quick look at how your Markdown content will render. Use headings,
lists, tables, quotes, code blocks, and images to make your pages more readable
and engaging.

```

This version **feels more like real content**, not just dev examples.  

I can also create an **even longer one that includes nested lists, multi-level quotes, and different content types** so you can stress-test your layout visually. Do you want me to do that?
```
