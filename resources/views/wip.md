I want to create a documentation page layout using grid and subgrid in a Blade
template that uses markdown for content. 

The layout should have a left sidebar for navigation, a main content area, and a
right sidebar for table of contents (TOC). The main content area should be
centered and have a maximum width controlled by a container class.

Currently, the markdown renderer injects the TOC inside the main content area,
directly before the rendered markdown content. This means I cannot simply create
a three-column grid layout because the TOC and content are siblings within the
main content area. structure is as follows:

**Current Markup Structure**

<main class="markdown-layout flex gap-05 txt-sm my">
    <aside class="left-sidebar w-18 bg-stripes-pink bdr-pink">
        <div class="bx">Left-Sidebar</div>
    </aside>
    <!-- WARNING: The structure below is critical. The TOC and rendered
    markdown content are injected by the Markdown All in One plugin and the
    markdown renderer. You must NOT modify, move, or remove the TOC
    container. -->
    <div class="main-content-area bg-stripes-fuchsia bdr-fuchsia fg1">
        <!-- you can not move the toc outside of the main-content-area div -->
        <div class="toc pxy bdr-5 bg-stripes-amber bdr-amber">
            <div class="bx">
                This area is reserved for the TOC generated by the Markdown All in One plugin.
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- Note, the div is just for visual purposes. Normally, it would be h1, p, etc. -->
        <div class="pxy bdr-5 bg-sky-100 bdr-sky mt">
            <div class="bx"> This area contains the rendered markdown content. </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</main>

In a perfect world, I would create a three-column grid layout like this,
however, the TOC is inside the main markdown content area so this structure will
not work:

I can not stress enough that the TOC must remain inside the main content area.
This is not negotiable!


THIS CODE PROVIDES IS A VISUAL REPRESENTATION ONLY AND WILL NOT WORK AS INTENDED
AS THE TOC IS INSIDE THE MAIN CONTENT AREA.

<main class="side-main-side my">
    <aside class="left-sidebar bg-stripes-pink bdr-pink">
        <div class="bx txt-sm txt-upper">Left-Sidebar</div>
    </aside>
    <div class="main-content-area bg-stripes-green bdr-green">
        <div class="docs-container bg-sky-100 bdr-sky">
            <div class="bx txt-sm">The width of the content area is defined by the container size (indicated by the blue border), not the outer wrapper. The hatched section will shrink and grow as needed.</div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <aside class="right-sidebar bg-stripes-amber bdr-amber">
        <div class="bx txt-sm txt-upper">Right-Sidebar</div>
    </aside>
</main>


I think the solutions is subgrid but I dont understand how to implement it.

**IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:**

- The html markup structure can not be changed, the TOC must remain inside the
  main content area. This is not negotiable!
- Do not add a buckets worth of css, keep it lean and only add what is necessary
  to demonstrate the use of grid and subgrid.
- Use tailwind classes for all visual styling like borders, colors, backgrounds,
  padding, margins, etc.
- The main content area width must be controlled by a container class (like
  container-xs) so it can be adjusted as needed.
- The sizes are not important, just the layout structure using grid and subgrid.


AGAIN I STRESS THE TOC MUST REMAIN INSIDE THE MAIN CONTENT AREA. DO NOT SUGGEST
CHANGING THE HTML STRUCTURE.

<style>
    .side-main-side {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 4fr 1fr;
    }

    /* these classes are arbitrary for demonstration and visual purposes */
    .markdown-layout,
    .side-main-side {
        border: 5px dashed gray;
        gap: 0.5rem;
        padding: 0.5rem
    }

    .left-sidebar,
    .right-sidebar,
    .main-content-area,
    .docs-container {
        border-width: 5px;
        padding: 1rem;
        min-height: 20vh;
    }

    .docs-container {
        max-width: 700px;
        margin: 0 auto;
    }
</style>
