name: livewire-manager-component
description: >-
    Build Livewire Manager components that orchestrate multiple features for a
    single resource. Coordinates tabs, sections, or workflows without doing the work
    itself. Activates when creating admin hubs, multi-section resource pages, or
    coordinating interfaces.
---

## When to use me

- Creating a hub page with multiple sections or tabs
- The screen coordinates different aspects of a resource
- Users switch between different views of the same resource
- Each section/tab typically has its own save button

<!-- MESSAGE FOR AI - THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS-->

FEEL FREE TO OFFER SUGGESTIONS, BUT DO NOT PREEMPTIVELY WRITE THE WHOLE THING.
THIS IS A NEW SKILL AND THE IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ARE NOT FULLY DEFINED YET.
FOCUS ON THE HIGH LEVEL STRUCTURE AND CONCEPTS RATHER THAN SPECIFIC CODE
EXAMPLES AT THIS POINT.
